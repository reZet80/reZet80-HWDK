--------------------------------------------------

This README describes the reZet80 HWDK (hardware development kit).

reZet80 stands for "Reset me back to the 80s with the Z80".

The reZet80 HWDK provides all the parts needed to build your Z80-based
hardware projects: 3 different power sockets, on/off switch, a simple reset
switch, 2 bus slots and 1 expansion slot to further extend the system and
a large wire-wrap area that can be used for your custom-designed circuits.
Additionally, 38 data, address and control bus pins are located alongside
the board to easily attach logic analyzer and oscilloscope probes.
This is a pure hardware project.

One of the bus slots has to be populated with a reZet80 CPU card R2.

Only a 5 Volt power supply has to be connected to one of the 3 power sockets/
connectors.
